# GPT-Driver
End to End automation



AI-driven solution to streamline the entire testing process, conversion of manual test cases to automation code (API, UI and Visual), test cases execution and report generation. The tool will also handle changes made to the manual test cases automatically by updating existing test cases or adding new ones as needed. 

GPT Driver uses AI for full automation of the testing process, involving the conversion of manual test cases into automation code utilizing Language Model Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Subsequently, these automated tests are executed, and comprehensive reports are generated.

A "no code solution" for testing. This automates the process of testing websites and applications. we  create manual test cases for both UI and API interactions. AI algorithms then convert these manual test cases into executable code. The system automatically executes the test cases  and generates detailed reports, indicating which test cases passed or failed and any issues encountered. This approach improves efficiency by reducing the risk of human errors and minimizing the potential for errors in testing procedures.
